## 📌 Project Overview

Maven Café sent promotional offers to its registered customers to boost sales over a 30-day period.  
This project analyzes customer responses to those offers and provides a **data-driven strategy** for future promotional messaging and targeting.

## 🎯 Business Questions

| # | Question |
|---|----------|
| Q1 | Which customer segment demonstrated the strongest response, and what offer structure should be used for future targeting? |
| Q2 | Which campaign generated the highest total revenue to justify its recurrence? |
| Q3 | Which offer mechanics and delivery timings achieved the highest conversion rates from "Offer Received" to "Offer Completed"? |

## 🗂️ Dataset

**Source:** [Kaggle — Café Rewards Offer Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arshmankhalid/caf-rewards-offer-dataset)

| Table | Count | Notes |
|-------|-------|-------|

## 🛠️ Tools & Methodology

```
Kaggle (CSV) ──► SQL Server (Cleaning + Views) ──► Power BI (Visualization)
```

- **Data Cleaning:** Used `JSON_VALUE` to parse nested JSON fields; filtered invalid records (age=118)
- **Feature Engineering:** Created CTEs with age, income, and membership tenure bins
- **Abstraction Layer:** SQL Views as Single Source of Truth for all business logic
- **Visualization:** Interactive dashboards built in Power BI
